Make sure you have bash and cern root installed!!

To install;

1) mkdir ~/.myPrograms (if it doesn't already exist)
2) cd ~/.myPrograms
3) ln -s route/directory/for/taglierina.sh taglierina
4) Add the following line at the end of your .bashrc (or .zshrc ...):

             export PATH=$PATH:~/.myPrograms

Any new terminal should be able to find "taglierina" when typed.
