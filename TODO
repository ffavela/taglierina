- Improve documentation.

- While looping throught the telescopes add a way to start from a
  certain value. (do a while in the file reading or something).

- Make an option to just plot without requiring the rootCutFile and
  the configuration part.

- Have a way to output cut histograms in a file not just the cut file
  or the mean etc.

- Include a sigmoid fitting (for punch through):

f(x)=c*(1-1/(1+exp(-b*(x-a))))

We are interested in the a parameter.

- Fix the binning of the cutted histograms. (Done I think)
