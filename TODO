- Improve documentation.

- Only use the configuration file if the -t option is required...?

- Implement options while on the cut, not just x (such as typing d for
 deleting a cut or b for going backward (if going through a loop)).

- While looping throught the telescopes add a way to start from a
  certain value. (do a while in the file reading or something).

- Make an option to just plot without requiring the rootCutFile and
  the configuration part.

- Have a way to output cut histograms in a file not just the cut file
  or the mean etc.

- A way to put normal cuts? (not just graphical ones...).
